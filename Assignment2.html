            d͡ʒʱiɽ̃ɑ]; born Mahomedali Jinnahbhai; 25 December 1876 – 11 September
            1948</center>
            was a barrister, politician, and the founder of Pakistan. Jinnah served as the leader of the All-India
            Muslim League from 1913 until the inception of Pakistan on 14 August 1947, and then as the Dominion of
            Pakistan's first governor-general until his death. Born at Wazir Mansion in Karachi, Jinnah was trained as a
            barrister at Lincoln's Inn in London. Upon his return to India, he enrolled at the Bombay High Court, and
            took an interest in national politics, which eventually replaced his legal practice. Jinnah rose to
            prominence in the Indian National Congress in the first two decades of the 20th century. In these early
            years of his political career, Jinnah advocated Hindu–Muslim unity, helping to shape the 1916 Lucknow Pact
            between the Congress and the All-India Muslim League, in which Jinnah had also become prominent. Jinnah
            became a key leader in the All-India Home Rule League, and proposed a fourteen-point constitutional reform
            plan to safeguard the political rights of Muslims in the Indian subcontinent. In 1920, however, Jinnah
            resigned from the Congress when it agreed to follow a campaign of satyagraha, which he regarded as political
            anarchy.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            By1940, Jinnah had come to believe that the Muslims of the subcontinent should have their own state to avoid
            the possible marginalised status they may gain in an independent Hindu–Muslim state. In that year, the
            Muslim League, led by Jinnah, passed the Lahore Resolution, demanding a separate nation for Indian Muslims.
            During the Second World War, the Muslim League gained strength while leaders of the Congress were
            imprisoned, and in the provincial election held shortly after the war, it won most of the seats reserved for
            Muslims. Ultimately, the Congress and the Muslim League could not reach a power-sharing formula that would
            allow the entirety of British India to be united as a single state following independence, leading all
            parties to agree instead to the independence of a predominantly Hindu India, and for a Muslim-majority state
            of Pakistan.
            <br><br>
            As the first governor-general of Pakistan, Jinnah worked to establish the new nation's government and
            policies, and to aid the millions of Muslim migrants who had emigrated from neighbouring India after
            thepartition in August 1947, personally supervising the establishment of refugee camps. Jinnah died a
            yearafter Pakistan's creation and was buried at Mazar-e-Quaid. He is revered in Pakistan as the
            Baba-e-Qaum("Father of the Nation") and Quaid-e-Azam ("Great Leader"). His birthday
            is observed as a national holiday
            in Pakistan.
